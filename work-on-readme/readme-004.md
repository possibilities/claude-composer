## What is Claude Composer?

Claude Composer is a CLI wrapper for Claude Code that adds small enhancements around automation, UX, and configuration.

Key benefits:

- **Reduced interruptions**: Automatically handles permission dialogs based on configurable rules
- **Enhanced visibility**: System notifications keep you informed without switching contexts
- **Flexible control**: Rulesets let you define exactly which actions to allow automatically
- **Tool injection**: Toolsets simplify activating tools and configuring tools permissions
