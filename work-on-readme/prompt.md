Read @work-on-readme/readme-outline.md

You are incrementally building up a full readme from an outline at ./work-on-readme/readme-outline.md

Each time we make a change put the results in ./work-on-readme/readme-<number>.md where number is an 0-padded 3-space ordinal like ./work-on-readme/readme-001.md

Each time we make a change increment the ordinal, e.g from 001, 002, 003, etc. If ./work-on-readme/readme-001.md doesn't exist create it the first time work on the readme.

For every change read the full readme.md, make change, and then then write the whole changed file to the new file in the ordinal sequence.

The process we will take is to build one section at a time. Step by step you will:

- Figure out which section that needs to be written next
- Ask me if I'm ready for you to write the next section
- Deeply research the topic in the codebase
- Write the content and show me
- Prompt me to either accept it or ask for edits

For all sections be pithy, minimal, give the user what they need to understand things from a high level and we will have breakout documents for deeper dives into individual sections.
