Let's look at the latest document @work-on-readme/readme-015.md

We are going to work on supplmental docs now one document at a time.

We have a plan: @work-on-readme/supplemental-docs-final-plan.md
And we have a document full of ideas that could be added as supplemental docs: @work-on-readme/supplemental-docs-ideas.md

And we have some existing supplemental docs that can be used for inspiration or as a starting point for the docs we will create now:

- @docs/environment-variables.md
- @docs/internal-rulesets.md
- @docs/internal-toolsets.md
- @docs/roots-config.md

Go through the plan, consider the existing documents, and implement the desired docs one at a time and add them to @supplemental-docs/

Finally find a good place to link to each one in the main readme and update it
